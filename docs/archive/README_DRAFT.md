## 📖 The "Code as Textbook" Philosophy

### What This Means

**Traditional Code:**
```python
@dataclass
class SearchOptions:
    """Configuration options."""
    model: str = "gpt-4o-mini"
```

**Our Textbook Code:**
```python
# ============================================================================
# BLUEPRINT 1: SearchOptions - Configuring the Search
# ============================================================================

@dataclass
class SearchOptions:
    """
    Configuration options for web search requests.
    
    📚 CONCEPT: Dataclasses
    -----------------------
    The @dataclass decorator is Python's way of saying "this is just data."
    It automatically generates __init__, __repr__, and __eq__ methods.
    
    Think of it like filling out a form:
    - model: Which AI model to use (like choosing your search engine)
    - allowed_domains: Only search these websites (site:example.com)
    
    📝 DESIGN DECISION: Default Values
    ----------------------------------
    If you don't specify a model, it defaults to "gpt-4o-mini" 
    (fastest, cheapest for learning).
    
    EXAMPLE USAGE:
    >>> options = SearchOptions(model="gpt-4o", reasoning_effort="high")
    """
    model: str = "gpt-4o-mini"  # Which AI model processes the search
```

### What You Get

Every file includes:
- **📖 Story Context** - Why this code exists in the bigger picture
- **💡 Learning Objectives** - What concepts you'll master
- **🎯 Design Decisions** - Why we chose this approach (and alternatives)
- **📝 Real-World Analogies** - Complex concepts explained through everyday examples
- **✨ Runnable Examples** - Code you can copy-paste and try immediately
- **🔗 Cross-References** - "See Chapter 3 for how this connects..."

### Learning Paths Available

Based on your experience, choose your path:

| Path | Best For | Start Chapter | Duration |
|------|----------|---------------|----------|
| **"I'm New to Python"** | Beginners learning syntax | Chapter 1 (Models) | 6-8 hours |
| **"Teach Me Architecture"** | Intermediate devs | Chapter 4 (Service) | 4-5 hours |
| **"Master Testing"** | Anyone wanting TDD mastery | Chapter 7 (Test Foundation) | 3-4 hours |

## 🆘 Getting Help: Your Support System

### During Class Sessions
1. **Ask your instructor** - No question is too basic
2. **Pair with classmates** - Two minds > one
3. **Use Claude in VS Code** - Your AI coding partner

### Outside Class Hours

#### 1. **Read the Textbook**
The code itself is documentation. Stuck on something?
- Open the relevant chapter in `src/`
- Read the narrative comments
- Try the examples
- Check related test file

#### 2. **Consult the Guides**
```bash
# Forgot TDD workflow?
cat docs/TDD_WORKFLOW.md

# Need git help?
cat docs/GIT_WORKFLOW.md

# API questions?
grep "embeddings" docs/openai_tools_research_oct2025.md
```

#### 3. **Use Claude Effectively**
Ask specific questions with context:

**❌ Bad:** "My code doesn't work"

**✅ Good:**
```
I'm building a recipe generator using Vision API. I'm trying to 
extract ingredients from a food photo. Here's my code:

[paste relevant code]

I'm getting this error: [paste error]

What's wrong and how do I fix it?
```

See [AI_COLLABORATION.md](docs/AI_COLLABORATION.md) for more tips.

#### 4. **Common Issues & Solutions**

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| **Tests failing?** | `pytest -v` to see details, read test names for clues |
| **Import errors?** | Activate virtual environment: `source venv/bin/activate` |
| **API key not working?** | Check `.env` file, verify key starts with `sk-` |
| **Coverage not 100%?** | `pytest --cov=src --cov-report=term-missing` shows gaps |
| **Git confused?** | `git status` then `git log --oneline` to see state |
| **Claude giving bad advice?** | Ask "Why?" and verify against reference code |

#### 5. **Debugging Workflow**

```bash
# 1. Reproduce the error
python -m src.main "test query"

# 2. Check logs
tail logs/app.log

# 3. Run specific test
pytest tests/test_client.py::TestWebSearchClient::test_search_with_basic_query -v

# 4. Use Python debugger
python -m pdb src/main.py

# 5. Ask for help with specifics
```

### Design Principles Demonstrated

1. **Separation of Concerns**
   - Models = data structure
   - Client = communication
   - Parser = transformation
   - Service = orchestration
   - Main = presentation

2. **Dependency Flow**
   ```
   main.py → service → client → OpenAI
                    ↓
                  parser → models
   ```

3. **Test Coverage**
   - Every source file has corresponding test file
   - `conftest.py` provides shared fixtures
   - Tests mirror source structure

4. **Documentation**
   - Code comments explain "why"
   - Docs provide context and guidance
   - Tests show usage examples

## 🌟 What Makes This Course Unique

### 1. Code IS the Textbook

**Traditional Approach:**
- Read documentation
- Look at code examples
- Try to connect them

**Our Approach:**
- Read the code itself
- Narrative comments teach concepts
- Documentation supplements, not replaces

### 2. Multiple Entry Points

**Everyone learns differently:**
- Visual learners → Explore file structure
- Reading learners → Follow chapter sequence
- Hands-on learners → Run examples immediately
- Systematic learners → Complete learning path

**All paths lead to mastery.**

### 3. Real-World Application

**Not a tutorial project:**
- Production-quality code
- Enterprise patterns
- Actual problems solved
- Industry-standard tools

**This is how professionals work.**

### 4. AI as Learning Partner

**Not AI dependency:**
- Learn to collaborate with AI
- Verify and validate outputs
- Understand what AI generates
- Use AI to learn faster, not replace learning

### 5. Immediate Applicability

**Skills transfer directly:**
- Any API integration project
- Any Python application
- Any testing scenario
- Any software role

**Build a portfolio piece while learning.**
