### 2. Instagram-Friendly Format
- Shorter sections with emojis
- Quick TL;DR summaries
- Scannable headers

- Go deeper if needed
- Archive has full details

## 📊 Before vs After

### ❌ Before (Information Overload)
```
Student lands on repo
README points to 7 docs
First doc is 28KB
Student overwhelmed
Student gives up
```

### ✅ After (Guided Path)
```
Student lands on repo
README says "Start with START_HERE.md"
5 minute read
Clear next steps
Student feels confident
Student succeeds
```

## 📝 Notes

### .gitignore Updated
Added `references/` folder for students to clone libraries:
```bash
# Students can now:
mkdir references
cd references
git clone https://github.com/openai/openai-python.git

# Then ask Claude to read from references/
```

### Nothing Was Deleted
All original docs moved to `docs/archive/` - still accessible but not required reading.

**Result: Students can get started in 35 minutes instead of feeling overwhelmed by 100KB of docs!** 🎉
