## 📖 The "Code as Textbook" Difference

**This isn't code with comments—it's a textbook written IN code.**

### What Traditional Code Looks Like:
```python
@dataclass
class SearchOptions:
    """Configuration options."""
    model: str = "gpt-4o-mini"
```

### What This Learning Code Looks Like:
```python
# ============================================================================
# BLUEPRINT 1: SearchOptions - Configuring the Search
# ============================================================================

@dataclass
class SearchOptions:
    """
    Configuration options for web search requests.
    
    📚 CONCEPT: Dataclasses
    -----------------------
    The @dataclass decorator auto-generates __init__, __repr__, __eq__ methods.
    It's Python's way of saying "this is just data."
    
    Think of it like a form:
    - model: Which AI to use (like choosing your search engine)
    - allowed_domains: Filter results (like Google's site:)
    
    📝 DESIGN DECISION: Default Values
    ----------------------------------
    Default to "gpt-4o-mini" (fastest, cheapest for learning).
    Students can override for production needs.
    
    EXAMPLE USAGE:
    >>> options = SearchOptions()  # Uses defaults
    >>> options = SearchOptions(model="gpt-4o")  # Custom model
    """
    model: str = "gpt-4o-mini"  # Which AI model processes searches
```

**Every file teaches:** Concepts • Design decisions • Real-world analogies • Runnable examples

## 🗺️ The Architecture Story

This web search application demonstrates production patterns:

```
User Query → Service (orchestrator) → Client (API) → OpenAI
    ↓                                       ↓
  Display  ← SearchResult ← Parser ← JSON Response
```

**File Structure:**
```
src/                          What Each File Teaches
├── models.py                 📖 Data structures, type hints, exceptions
├── client.py                 📖 API clients, error handling, secrets management
├── parser.py                 📖 Data transformation, defensive parsing
├── search_service.py         📖 Service layer, validation, composition
├── main.py                   📖 CLI design, argparse, user experience
└── logging_config.py         📖 Enterprise logging, rotation, JSON format

tests/                        What Each Test Teaches
├── conftest.py               📖 pytest fixtures, test data, mocking
├── test_models.py            📖 Unit testing, edge cases, properties
├── test_client.py            📖 Mocking external APIs, error simulation
├── test_parser.py            📖 Data transformation testing, malformed input
├── test_search_service.py    📖 Integration testing, component interaction
└── test_main.py              📖 System testing, CLI verification
```

**Key Insight:** Each source file pairs with a test file. This is how professionals work.

## 🆘 Getting Help

### During Class
1. **Ask instructor** - No question too basic
2. **Pair with classmates** - Two perspectives better than one
3. **Use Claude** - Your AI coding partner

### Outside Class

#### Read the Code
The code IS the documentation:
```bash
# Stuck on something?
1. Find relevant file in src/
2. Read narrative comments
3. Try examples
4. Check corresponding test file
```

#### Consult Guides
```bash
# Quick reference
cat docs/TDD_WORKFLOW.md      # Forgot TDD steps?
cat docs/GIT_WORKFLOW.md       # Need git help?
grep "vision" docs/openai_tools_research_oct2025.md  # API questions?
```

#### Ask Claude Effectively

❌ **Bad:** "my code doesnt work"

✅ **Good:**
```
I'm building [feature] using [API]. I'm trying to [goal].

Here's my code:
[paste relevant code]

Here's the error:
[paste error]

I tried [what you tried]. What should I do?
```

See [AI_COLLABORATION.md](docs/AI_COLLABORATION.md) for more.

### Common Issues

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Tests failing? | `pytest -v` for details |
| Import errors? | `source venv/bin/activate` |
| API key issues? | Check `.env`, verify starts with `sk-` |
| Low coverage? | `pytest --cov=src --cov-report=term-missing` |
| Git confused? | `git status && git log --oneline` |
| Claude bad advice? | Verify against reference code, ask "why?" |

---
