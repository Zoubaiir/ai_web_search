## üö® Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: "My API calls are too slow"
**Solution:** 
- Use mocking in tests (don't call real API in tests!)
- Show them the conftest.py fixtures
- Explain caching strategies

### Issue 2: "I can't get 100% coverage"
**Solution:**
- Review what's uncovered: `pytest --cov=src --cov-report=html`
- Explain `pragma: no cover` for defensive code
- Help them write tests for the tricky parts

### Issue 3: "I'm stuck and don't know what to do"
**Solution:**
- "What's the smallest next step?"
- "Can you write a test for it?"
- "Ask Claude for help with this specific thing"

### Issue 4: "My project is too complex"
**Solution:**
- "What's the core feature?"
- "Can you cut features and still have something cool?"
- "Scope down to MVP"

### Issue 5: "I don't understand how to use Claude"
**Solution:**
- Show them example prompts from AI_PROMPTS.md
- Model a conversation with Claude
- Emphasize: "Give Claude context, be specific"

### Issue 6: "Git is confusing"
**Solution:**
- Show them the basic workflow:
  ```bash
  # After writing code
  git status                  # See what changed
  git add file.py            # Stage the file
  git commit -m "feat: Add X"  # Commit with message
  git push                   # Push to GitHub
  ```
- Reference GIT_GUIDE.md

## üéØ Key Teaching Moments

### Emphasize These Concepts:

1. **TDD is not "testing"** - it's a design methodology
   - Write test FIRST
   - Think about API before implementation
   - Tests as documentation

2. **AI is a partner, not a crutch**
   - You should understand every line
   - Ask "why?" questions
   - Verify AI's suggestions

3. **Enterprise patterns matter**
   - Logging helps you debug
   - Clean code is maintainable
   - Tests give confidence

4. **Git tells a story**
   - Commit messages matter
   - Atomic commits are professional
   - Your GitHub is your portfolio

5. **Scope management**
   - MVP first, polish later
   - Done is better than perfect
   - You can always add features later

## üìà Assessment Tips

### Code Review Checklist:

**Browse their GitHub:**
- [ ] Has meaningful commit messages? (feat:, fix:, test:, docs:)
- [ ] Commits are atomic? (one logical change each)
- [ ] README is clear and complete?
- [ ] Tests are comprehensive?
- [ ] Code is clean and well-structured?

**Run their code:**
```bash
git clone [their-repo]
cd [their-repo]
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
pytest --cov=src
python -m src.main [command]
```

**Check logs:**
```bash
ls -la logs/
tail logs/app.log
```

### Red Flags:
- ‚ùå All commits on last day (they procrastinated)
- ‚ùå Commit messages like "fixed stuff" (didn't follow guide)
- ‚ùå No tests or very low coverage (didn't use TDD)
- ‚ùå No logs directory (didn't add logging)
- ‚ùå Can't explain their code (copied without understanding)

### Green Flags:
- ‚úÖ Commits spread across 2 weeks (good time management)
- ‚úÖ Clean commit history (followed Git guide)
- ‚úÖ 100% coverage (took testing seriously)
- ‚úÖ Logs with context (understood logging)
- ‚úÖ Can explain decisions (understood the work)
