# 📖 Code as Textbook: A Narrative Guide

## 🎯 The Story of Building a Web Search Application

Welcome to a unique learning experience. This isn't just code with comments - it's a **story told through code**. Each file is a chapter, each function is a scene, and each concept is explained as if we're sitting together, building this application from scratch.

## 🛠️ How to Use This Textbook

### 1. **Read Actively, Not Passively**
Don't just read the code - run it, break it, fix it.

```bash
# Open two terminals side by side:
# Terminal 1: Edit the code
code src/models.py

# Terminal 2: Run tests to see effects
pytest tests/test_models.py -v
```

### 2. **Follow the Breadcrumbs**
Comments reference each other:
> "📝 See Chapter 3 for how we parse this response"

Jump between files to see the full picture.

### 3. **Experiment Freely**
The code is heavily tested (69 tests, 100% coverage). You can:
- Change things
- Break things  
- Run tests to see what you broke
- Read error messages to understand why

```bash
# Make a change
vim src/models.py

# See if tests catch it
pytest

# See coverage impact
pytest --cov=src --cov-report=html
open htmlcov/index.html
```

### 4. **Use the "Why" Sections**
Every major concept has a "📝 DESIGN DECISION" or "💡 WHY THIS MATTERS" section.

These explain:
- **What**: The code does
- **Why**: We wrote it this way
- **Alternatives**: What we didn't do (and why)

### 5. **Try the Examples**
Most sections have runnable examples:

```python
>>> # This is an example you can copy-paste into Python REPL
>>> from src.models import SearchOptions
>>> options = SearchOptions(model="gpt-4o")
>>> print(options)
```

Run them in `python` or `ipython` to see how things work.

```python
if not valid_input(data):

```python
def api_method(self, required: str, optional: Optional[str] = None) -> ReturnType:
    """Clear docstring."""
    payload = self._build_payload(required, optional)
    response = self._make_request(payload)
    return self._parse_response(response)
```

**Test Pattern:**
```python
def test_feature_with_valid_input(fixture1, fixture2):
    """Test that valid input produces expected output."""
    # Arrange: Set up test data
    # Act: Call the function
    # Assert: Verify results
