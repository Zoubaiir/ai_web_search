## Professional Practices (25 points)

### Test-Driven Development (10 points)

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| **10** | Clear TDD workflow, tests written first, evidence in git history |
| **8** | Mostly TDD, occasional deviations |

**How We Verify:**
```bash
# Look at git history
git log --oneline --all

# We look for commits like:
# test: add tests for user authentication
# feat: implement user authentication
# (test commit BEFORE feat commit = TDD)
```

**Evidence of TDD:**
- Test commits before feature commits
- Tests for features that don't exist yet

    logger.info(f"Processing image: {image_path}")
    
    try:
        logger.debug(f"Image size: {os.path.getsize(image_path)} bytes")
        result = analyze(image_path)
        logger.info(f"Analysis complete: {result.confidence}% confidence")
        return result
