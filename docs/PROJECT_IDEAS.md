### Step 3: Break Down Components

**Template:**
```
Data Models:
- Model 1 (what data?)
- Model 2 (what data?)

API Clients:
- Client 1 (calls which API?)
- Client 2 (calls which API?)

Business Logic:
- Service 1 (does what?)
- Parser 1 (parses what?)

CLI:
- What commands?
- What arguments?
```

---

## 💡 Pro Tips for Project Selection

### Tip #1: Pick Something You'd Use
**Why:** You'll be more motivated, better at testing edge cases

**Example:** Love cooking? → Recipe generator
**Example:** Struggle with writing? → Content assistant

---

### Tip #2: Start with Starter, Upgrade if Time
**Why:** Better to finish a simple project than abandon complex one

**Plan:**
- Week 1: Build starter version
- Week 2: If ahead, add features

---

### Tip #3: Think About the Demo
**Why:** Grading includes demo quality

**Good demo:**
- Shows real input/output
- Explains one interesting technical choice
- Shows test coverage
- Runs smoothly

**Bad demo:**
- Too complex to explain
- Breaks during demo
- All code, no results

---

### Tip #4: Ask "What Could Go Wrong?"
**Why:** Good projects handle errors gracefully

**Questions:**
- What if API is down?
- What if input is empty?
- What if response is malformed?
- What if rate limit hit?

**These become your test cases!**
